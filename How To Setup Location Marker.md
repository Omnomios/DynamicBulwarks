1 - Open the mission in the editor.\
2 - Place a marker called "bulwark_zone_0" where you want your location to be. || If you want multiple possible locations copy the marker and paste as many times as you want.\
3 - There is a red marker with the marker text: "This marker needs to have the mapname of the current map, as variable Name for location markers to work". Change its variable name to the world your playing. For example "tanoa" or "malden". \
That is it, your done.
\
To use your placed markers select "Position" > "Use location markers" in the mission parameter.\
\
Keep in mind:\
The Bulwark will be on the exact location where the marker is.\
Make sure there is loot nearby or place some houses in editor that can spawn loot.\
You can't spawn on buildings with this, always places you on ground.
